	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may adversely affect a person's thinking, memory, personality, and behavior. While mild TBI (mTBI) diagnosis is challenging, there is a risk for long-term psychiatric, neurologic, and psychosocial problems in some patients that motivates the search for new and better biomarkers. Recently, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) has shown promise in detecting mTBI, but its validity is still being investigated. Resting state functional network connectivity (rsFNC) is another approach that is emerging as a promising option for the diagnosis of mTBI. The present work investigated the use of rsFNC for mTBI detection compared with dMRI results on the same cohort. Fifty patients with mTBI (25 males) and age-sex matched healthy controls were recruited. Features from dMRI were obtained using all voxels, the enhanced Z-score microstructural assessment for pathology, and the distribution corrected Z-score. Features based on rsFNC were obtained through group independent component analysis and correlation between pairs of resting state networks. A linear support vector machine was used for classification and validated using leave-one-out cross validation. Classification achieved a maximum accuracy of 84.1\% for rsFNC and 75.5\% for dMRI and 74.5\% for both combined. A t test analysis revealed significant increase in rsFNC between cerebellum versus sensorimotor networks and between left angular gyrus versus precuneus in subjects with mTBI. These outcomes suggest that inclusion of both common and unique information is important for classification of mTBI. Results also suggest that rsFNC can yield viable biomarkers that might outperform dMRI and points to connectivity to the cerebellum as an important region for the detection of mTBI.},

	abstract = {Identifying diffuse axonal injury (DAI) in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) presenting with normal appearing radiological MRI presents a significant challenge. Neuroimaging methods such as diffusion MRI and probabilistic tractography, which probe the connectivity of neural networks, show significant promise. We present a machine learning approach to classify TBI participants primarily with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) based on altered structural connectivity patterns derived through the network based statistical analysis of structural connectomes generated from TBI and age-matched control groups. In this approach, higher order diffusion models were used to map white matter connections between 116 cortical and subcortical regions. Tracts between these regions were generated using probabilistic tracking and mean fractional anisotropy (FA) measures along these connections were encoded in the connectivity matrices. Network-based statistical analysis of the connectivity matrices was performed to identify the network differences between a representative subset of the two groups. The affected network connections provided the feature vectors for principal component analysis and subsequent classification by random forest. The validity of the approach was tested using data acquired from a total of 179 TBI patients and 146 controls participants. The analysis revealed altered connectivity within a number of intra- and inter-hemispheric white matter pathways associated with DAI, in consensus with existing literature. A mean classification accuracy of 68.16\%±1.81\% and mean sensitivity of 80.0\%±2.36\% were achieved in correctly classifying the TBI patients evaluated on the subset of the participants that was not used for the statistical analysis, in a 10-fold cross-validation framework. These results highlight the potential for statistical machine learning approaches applied to structural connectomes to identify patients with diffusive axonal injury.},

The purpose of this study is the novel application of data mining (DM) techniques to predict the outcomes of cognitive rehabilitation in patients with ABI. We generate three predictive models that allow us to obtain new knowledge to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the cognitive rehabilitation process. Decision tree (DT), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and general regression neural network (GRNN) have been used to construct the prediction models. 10-fold cross validation was carried out in order to test the algorithms, using the Institut Guttmann Neurorehabilitation Hospital (IG) patients database. Performance of the models was tested through specificity, sensitivity and accuracy analysis and confusion matrix analysis. The experimental results obtained by DT are clearly superior with a prediction average accuracy of 90.38\%, while MLP and GRRN obtained a 78.7\% and 75.96\%, respectively.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose bag of adversarial features (BAFs) for identifying mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) patients from their diffusion magnetic resonance images (MRIs) (obtained within one month of injury) by incorporating unsupervised feature learning techniques. MTBI is a growing public health problem with an estimated incidence of over 1.7 million people annually in USA. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and symptoms, and accurate, concrete measures of injury are lacking. Unlike most of the previous works, which use hand-crafted features extracted from different parts of brain for MTBI classification, we employ feature learning algorithms to learn more discriminative representation for this task. A major challenge in this field thus far is the relatively small number of subjects available for training. This makes it difficult to use an end-to-end convolutional neural network to directly classify a subject from MRIs. To overcome this challenge, we first apply an adversarial auto-encoder (with convolutional structure) to learn patch-level features, from overlapping image patches extracted from different brain regions. We then aggregate these features through a bag-of-words approach. We perform an extensive experimental study on a dataset of 227 subjects (including 109 MTBI patients, and 118 age and sex-matched healthy controls) and compare the bag-of-deep-features with several previous approaches. Our experimental results show that the BAF significantly outperforms earlier works relying on the mean values of MR metrics in selected brain regions.},

	abstract = {Objective:
The purpose of this study was to develop an algorithm incorporating MRI metrics to classify patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and controls.

Methods:
This was an institutional review board–approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant prospective study. We recruited patients with mTBI and healthy controls through the emergency department and general population. We acquired data on a 3.0T Siemens Trio magnet including conventional brain imaging, resting-state fMRI, diffusion-weighted imaging, and magnetic field correlation (MFC), and performed multifeature analysis using the following MRI metrics: mean kurtosis (MK) of thalamus, MFC of thalamus and frontal white matter, thalamocortical resting-state networks, and 5 regional gray matter and white matter volumes including the anterior cingulum and left frontal and temporal poles. Feature selection was performed using minimal-redundancy maximal-relevance. We used classifiers including support vector machine, naive Bayesian, Bayesian network, radial basis network, and multilayer perceptron to test maximal accuracy.

Results:
We studied 24 patients with mTBI and 26 controls. Best single-feature classification uses thalamic MK yielding 74\% accuracy. Multifeature analysis yields 80\% accuracy using the full feature set, and up to 86\% accuracy using minimal-redundancy maximal-relevance feature selection (MK thalamus, right anterior cingulate volume, thalamic thickness, thalamocortical resting-state network, thalamic microscopic MFC, and sex).

Conclusion:
Multifeature analysis using diffusion-weighted imaging, MFC, fMRI, and volumetrics may aid in the classification of patients with mTBI compared with controls based on optimal feature selection and classification methods.

Classification of evidence:
This study provides Class III evidence that classification algorithms using multiple MRI features accurately identifies patients with mTBI as defined by American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine criteria compared with healthy controls.},

Here, data mining methods were combined with serial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores and clinical and laboratory parameters to predict 6-month functional outcome and mortality in patients with TBI. Data of consecutive adult patients presenting at a trauma center with moderate-to-severe head injury were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical parameters including serial GCS measurements at emergency department, 7th day, and 14th day and laboratory data were included for analysis (n = 115). We employed artificial neural network (ANN), naïve Bayes (NB), decision tree, and logistic regression to predict mortality and functional outcomes at 6 months after TBI. Favorable functional outcome was achieved by 34.8 \% of the patients, and overall 6-month mortality was 25.2 \%. For 6-month functional outcome prediction, ANN was the best model, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 96.13 \%, sensitivity of 83.50 \%, and specificity of 89.73 \%. The best predictive model for mortality was NB with AUC of 91.14 \%, sensitivity of 81.17 \%, and specificity of 90.65 \%. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated GCS measurements on the 7th and 14th day and difference between emergency room and 14th day GCS score as the most influential attributes both in mortality and functional outcome prediction models. Analysis of serial GCS measurements using data mining methods provided additional predictive information in relation to 6-month mortality and functional outcome in patients with moderate-to-severe TBI.},

In medical diagnosis, it is important to not only maximize correct classifications, but also to minimize Type I and Type II errors.

We face two challenges. First, we have less information on healthy participants than on the patients. Second, the values of the medical tests for patients, even after treatment started, remain well-separated from those of healthy people; this is typical for neurodegenerative diseases, but also for further brain impairments.

	abstract = {Significant advances have been made towards building accurate automatic segmentation systems for a variety of biomedical applications using machine learning. However, the performance of these systems often degrades when they are applied on new data that differ from the training data, for example, due to variations in imaging protocols. Manually annotating new data for each test domain is not a feasible solution. In this work we investigate unsupervised domain adaptation using adversarial neural networks to train a segmentation method which is more robust to differences in the input data, and which does not require any annotations on the test domain. Specifically, we derive domain-invariant features by learning to counter an adversarial network, which attempts to classify the domain of the input data by observing the activations of the segmentation network. Furthermore, we propose a multi-connected domain discriminator for improved adversarial training. Our system is evaluated using two MR databases of subjects with traumatic brain injuries, acquired using different scanners and imaging protocols. Using our unsupervised approach, we obtain segmentation accuracies which are close to the upper bound of supervised domain adaptation.},

	abstract = {Cognitive rehabilitation (CR) treatment consists of hierarchically organized tasks that require repetitive use of impaired cognitive functions in a progressively more demanding sequence. Active monitoring of the progress of the subjects is therefore required, and the difficulty of the tasks must be progressively increased, always pushing the subjects to reach a goal just beyond what they can attain. There is an important lack of well-established criteria by which to identify the right tasks to propose to the patient. In this paper, the NeuroRehabilitation Range (NRR) is introduced as a means of identifying formal operational models. These are to provide the therapist with dynamic decision support information for assigning the most appropriate CR plan to each patient. Data mining techniques are used to build data-driven models for NRR. The Sectorized and Annotated Plane (SAP) is proposed as a visual tool by which to identify NRR, and two data-driven methods to build the SAP are introduced and compared. Application to a specific representative cognitive task is presented. The results obtained suggest that the current clinical hypothesis about NRR might be reconsidered. Prior knowledge in the area is taken into account to introduce the number of task executions and task performance into NRR models and a new model is proposed which outperforms the current clinical hypothesis. The NRR is introduced as a key concept to provide an operational model identifying when a patient is experiencing activities in his or her Zone of Proximal Development and, consequently, experiencing maximum improvement. For the first time, data collected through a CR platform has been used to find a model for the NRR.},

	abstract = {Objective
The main purpose of this research is the novel use of artificial metaplasticity on multilayer perceptron (AMMLP) as a data mining tool for prediction the outcome of patients with acquired brain injury (ABI) after cognitive rehabilitation. The final goal aims at increasing knowledge in the field of rehabilitation theory based on cognitive affectation.
Methods and materials
The data set used in this study contains records belonging to 123 ABI patients with moderate to severe cognitive affectation (according to Glasgow Coma Scale) that underwent rehabilitation at Institut Guttmann Neurorehabilitation Hospital (IG) using the tele-rehabilitation platform PREVIRNEC©. The variables included in the analysis comprise the neuropsychological initial evaluation of the patient (cognitive affectation profile), the results of the rehabilitation tasks performed by the patient in PREVIRNEC© and the outcome of the patient after a 3–5 months treatment. To achieve the treatment outcome prediction, we apply and compare three different data mining techniques: the AMMLP model, a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and a C4.5 decision tree.
Results
The prediction performance of the models was measured by ten-fold cross validation and several architectures were tested. The results obtained by the AMMLP model are clearly superior, with an average predictive performance of 91.56\%. BPNN and C4.5 models have a prediction average accuracy of 80.18\% and 89.91\% respectively. The best single AMMLP model provided a specificity of 92.38\%, a sensitivity of 91.76\% and a prediction accuracy of 92.07\%.
Conclusions
The proposed prediction model presented in this study allows to increase the knowledge about the contributing factors of an ABI patient recovery and to estimate treatment efficacy in individual patients. The ability to predict treatment outcomes may provide new insights toward improving effectiveness and creating personalized therapeutic interventions based on clinical evidence.},

The Patient Informatics Processing Software semi-automates the data collection process onboard ships. Then data within these images are captured and used to populate a database, after which multiple ship databases are used for reporting and analysis. In this paper, we used the Patient Informatics Processing Software Hybrid Hadoop Hive to orchestrate database processing via various ships, by marshaling the distributed servers, running the various tasks in parallel, managing all of the communications and data transfers between the various parts of the system, and providing for redundancy and fault tolerance. Then we employed the Apache Hive as a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop for data summarization, query, and analysis to identify traumatic brain injury (TBI) as well as other injury cases. Finally, a proposed Misdiagnosis Minimization Approach method was used for data analysis. We collected data on three ship variables (Byrd, Boxer, Kearsage) and injuries to four body regions (head, torso, extremities, and abrasions) to determine how the set of collected variables relates to the body injuries. Two dimensions or canonical variables (survival vs. mortality) were necessary to understand the association between the two sets of variables. Our method improved data classification and showed that survival, mortality, and morbidity rates can be derived from the superset of Medical Operations data and used for future decision-making and planning. We suggest that an awareness of procedural errors as well as methods to reduce misclassification should be incorporated into all TBI clinical trials.},

Improvements in diagnostic methodologies are necessary given that current clinical techniques have limited accuracy and are solely based on self-reports. Recently, resting state functional network connectivity (FNC) has shown potential as an important imaging modality for the development of mTBI biomarkers. The present work explores the use of dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) for mTBI detection. Forty eight mTBI patients (24 males) and age-gender matched healthy controls were recruited. We identified a set of dFNC states and looked at the possibility of using each state to classify subjects in mTBI patients and healthy controls. A linear support vector machine was used for classification and validated using leave-one-out cross validation. One of the dFNC states achieved a high classification performance of 92\% using the area under the curve method. A series of t-test analysis revealed significant dFNC increases between cerebellum and sensorimotor networks. This significant increase was detected in the same dFNC state useful for classification. Results suggest that dFNC can be used to identify optimal dFNC states for classification excluding those that does not contain useful features.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury remains a global health problem. Understanding the relative importance of outcome predictors helps optimize our treatment strategies by informing assessment protocols, clinical decisions and trial designs. In this study we establish importance ranking for outcome predictors based on receiver operating indices to identify key predictors of outcome and create simple predictive models. We then explore the associations between key outcome predictors using Bayesian networks to gain further insight into predictor importance.
METHODS: We analyzed the corticosteroid randomization after significant head injury (CRASH) trial database of 10008 patients and included patients for whom demographics, injury characteristics, computer tomography (CT) findings and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GCS) were recorded (total of 13 predictors, which would be available to clinicians within a few hours following the injury in 6945 patients). Predictions of clinical outcome (death or severe disability at 6 months) were performed using logistic regression models with 5-fold cross validation. Predictive performance was measured using standardized partial area (pAUC) under the receiver operating curve (ROC) and we used Delong test for comparisons. Variable importance ranking was based on pAUC targeted at specificity (pAUCSP) and sensitivity (pAUCSE) intervals of 90-100\%. Probabilistic associations were depicted using Bayesian networks.
RESULTS: Complete AUC analysis showed very good predictive power (AUC = 0.8237, 95\% CI: 0.8138-0.8336) for the complete model. Specificity focused importance ranking highlighted age, pupillary, motor responses, obliteration of basal cisterns/3rd ventricle and midline shift. Interestingly when targeting model sensitivity, the highest-ranking variables were age, severe extracranial injury, verbal response, hematoma on CT and motor response. Simplified models, which included only these key predictors, had similar performance (pAUCSP = 0.6523, 95\% CI: 0.6402-0.6641 and pAUCSE = 0.6332, 95\% CI: 0.62-0.6477) compared to the complete models (pAUCSP = 0.6664, 95\% CI: 0.6543-0.679, pAUCSE = 0.6436, 95\% CI: 0.6289-0.6585, de Long p value 0.1165 and 0.3448 respectively). Bayesian networks showed the predictors that did not feature in the simplified models were associated with those that did.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that importance based variable selection allows simplified predictive models to be created while maintaining prediction accuracy. Variable selection targeting specificity confirmed key components of clinical assessment in TBI whereas sensitivity based ranking suggested extracranial injury as one of the important predictors. These results help refine our approach to head injury assessment, decision-making and outcome prediction targeted at model sensitivity and specificity. Bayesian networks proved to be a comprehensive tool for depicting probabilistic associations for key predictors giving insight into why the simplified model has maintained accuracy.},

	abstract = {The heterogeneity of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is considered one of the most significant barriers to finding effective therapeutic interventions. In October, 2007, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, with support from the Brain Injury Association of America, the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, and the National Institute of Disability and Rehabilitation Research, convened a workshop to outline the steps needed to develop a reliable, efficient and valid classification system for TBI that could be used to link specific patterns of brain and neurovascular injury with appropriate therapeutic interventions. Currently, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is the primary selection criterion for inclusion in most TBI clinical trials. While the GCS is extremely useful in the clinical management and prognosis of TBI, it does not provide specific information about the pathophysiologic mechanisms which are responsible for neurological deficits and targeted by interventions. On the premise that brain injuries with similar pathoanatomic features are likely to share common pathophysiologic mechanisms, participants proposed that a new, multidimensional classification system should be developed for TBI clinical trials. It was agreed that preclinical models were vital in establishing pathophysiologic mechanisms relevant to specific pathoanatomic types of TBI and verifying that a given therapeutic approach improves outcome in these targeted TBI types. In a clinical trial, patients with the targeted pathoanatomic injury type would be selected using an initial diagnostic entry criterion, including their severity of injury. Coexisting brain injury types would be identified and multivariate prognostic modeling used for refinement of inclusion/exclusion criteria and patient stratification. Outcome assessment would utilize endpoints relevant to the targeted injury type. Advantages and disadvantages of currently available diagnostic, monitoring, and assessment tools were discussed. Recommendations were made for enhancing the utility of available or emerging tools in order to facilitate implementation of a pathoanatomic classification approach for clinical trials.},

Common data elements in radiologic imaging of traumatic brain injury. Radiologic brain imaging is the most useful means of visualizing and categorizing the location, nature, and degree of damage to the central nervous system sustained by patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). In addition to determining acute patient management and prognosis, imaging is crucial for the characterization and classification of injuries for natural history studies and clinical trials. This article is the initial result of a workshop convened by multiple national health care agencies in March 2009 to begin to make recommendations for potential data elements dealing with specific radiologic features and definitions needed to characterize injuries, as well as specific techniques and parameters needed to optimize radiologic data acquisition. The neuroimaging work group included professionals with expertise in basic imaging research and physics, clinical neuroradiology, neurosurgery, neurology, physiatry, psychiatry, TBI research, and research database formation. This article outlines the rationale and overview of their specific recommendations. In addition, we review the contributions of various imaging modalities to the understanding of TBI and the general principles needed for database flexibility and evolution over time to accommodate technical advances.},
